Manage your database with or without abstraction. This library is built on the PHP PDO plugin and is mainly used to build and execute SQL queries.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0 and later.
- PHP PDO extension.

## Supported Databases

This library should work correctly in almost any database that uses basic SQL syntax.
Databases supported by PDO and suitable drivers are available at [https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.drivers.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.drivers.php).

## Installation

```
composer require initorm/orm
```

## Usage

### Model and Entity

Model and Entity; are two common concepts used in database abstraction. To explain these two concepts in the roughest way;

- **Model :** Each model is a class that represents a table in the database.
- **Entity :** Entity is a class that represents a single row of data.

The most basic example of a model class would look like this.

```php
namespace App\Model;

class Posts extends \InitORM\ORM\Model
{

    /**
    * If your model will use a connection other than your global connection, provide connection information.
    * @var array|null <p>Default : NULL</p> 
    */
    protected array $credentials = [
        'dsn'               => '',
        'username'          => 'root',
        'password'          => '',
        'charset'           => 'utf8mb4',
        'collation'         => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
    ];

    /**
     * If not specified, \InitORM\ORM\Entity::class is used by default.
     * 
     * @var string<\InitORM\ORM\Entity>
     */
    protected $entity = \App\Entities\PostEntity::class;

    /**
     * If not specified, the name of your model class is used.
     * 
     * @var string
     */
    protected string $schema = 'posts';

    /**
     * The name of the PRIMARY KEY column.
     * 
     * @var string
     */
    protected string $schemaId = 'id';

    /**
     * Specify FALSE if you want the data to be permanently deleted.
     * 
     * @var bool
     */
    protected bool $useSoftDeletes = true;

    /**
     * Column name to hold the creation time of the data.
     * 
     * @var string|null
     */
    protected ?string $createdField = 'created_at';

    /**
     * The column name to hold the last time the data was updated.
     * 
     * @var string|null
     */
    protected ?string $updatedField = 'updated_at';

    /**
     * Column name to keep deletion time if $useSoftDeletes is active.
     * 
     * @var string|null
     */
    protected ?string $deletedField = 'deleted_at';

    protected bool $readable = true;

    protected bool $writable = true;

    protected bool $deletable = true;

    protected bool $updatable = true;
    
}
```

The most basic example of a entity class would look like this.

```php
namespace App\Entities;

class PostEntity extends \InitORM\ORM\Entity 
{
    /**
     * An example of a getter method for the "post_title" column.
     * 
     * Usage : 
     * echo $entity->post_title;
     */
    public function getPostTitleAttribute($title)
    {
        return strtoupper($title);
    }
    
    /**
     * An example of a setter method for the "post_title" column.
     * 
     * Usage : 
     * $entity->post_title = 'New Post Title';
     */
    public function setPostTitleAttribute($title)
    {
        $this->post_title = strtolower($title);
    }
    
}
```
